# About
This article aims to design a novel binary version of the AEFA scheme to improve the performance
of the original AEFA scheme in discrete space. The popular S-shaped and V-shaped functions are used to design the binary
versions of the AEFA. The efficiency and the optimization ability of the proposed binary versions of the AEFA are studied
theoretically as well as experimentally. An extensive experimental study is performed to understand the performance of the
proposed schemes. A set of 24 benchmark problems are solved using binary versions of AEFA the experimental results are
compared with nine state-of-the-art algorithms.
